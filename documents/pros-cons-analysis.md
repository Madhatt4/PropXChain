## Transition Period Considerations

The shift from conventional to blockchain-based property transactions will require a transition period with several key considerations:

1. **Dual System Operation**: Initially running both systems in parallel allows for gradual migration
2. **Training and Education**: All stakeholders will need education on the new processes
3. **Incremental Automation**: Begin with blockchain verification before implementing full smart contract automation
4. **Legal Framework Evolution**: Work with legal authorities to develop recognition for blockchain verification
5. **Data Migration Strategy**: Plan for incorporating existing property records into the blockchain system

The transition strategy focusing on new builds provides a controlled environment to demonstrate system benefits before expanding to the more complex resale market.
