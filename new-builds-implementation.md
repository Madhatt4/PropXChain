# Blockchain Property Transaction System
## Implementation Strategy for New Build Properties

---

## Why Start With New Builds?

New build properties provide the ideal starting point for implementing the blockchain property transaction system for several compelling reasons:

### 1. Standardized Documentation
- Uniform property information across development sites
- Standardized warranties and building specifications
- Identical planning and regulatory approvals
- Consistent property types and features within developments

### 2. Developer Control
- Single entity (developer) controls the seller side
- In-house legal teams can help shape system requirements
- Developers have financial motivation to speed up sales
- Volume of properties justifies system implementation costs

### 3. Technical Advantages
- No historical title complications or chain dependencies
- Clean starting point for property documentation
- Similar properties allow process templating
- Digital documentation often already exists

### 4. Market Advantages
- First-time buyers more receptive to innovative processes
- Higher transaction volume provides faster feedback cycle
- Developers can promote faster completions as selling point
- Warranty information benefits from blockchain verification

- Develop full metrics on time/cost savings

**Key Deliverables:**
- Smart contract modules for conditional steps
- Mortgage API integration
- Transaction efficiency metrics
- Pipeline for developer expansion

### Phase 3: Full System Deployment (Months 13-18)
- Expand to multiple developers across Wales
- Implement complete smart contract automation
- Integrate with Land Registry systems
- Deploy LLM-assisted document analysis
- Create full property passport functionality

**Key Deliverables:**
- Complete blockchain transaction system
- Developer onboarding process
- Legal firm integration process
- Property resale capability

### Phase 4: Market Expansion (Months 19-24)
- Expand to major national developers
- Develop estate agent interface for wider distribution
- Create pathways for resale property inclusion
- Implement enhanced analytics and reporting
- Begin international market assessment

**Key Deliverables:**
- National developer partnerships
- Estate agent channel strategy
- Resale property integration plan
- Advanced analytics dashboard
