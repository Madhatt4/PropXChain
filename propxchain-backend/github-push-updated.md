# Updated GitHub Push Guide for PropXchain

Based on the git log output, I can see that you already have an active GitHub repository with several commits. The repository is using the branch name "main" (not "master"), which explains the error you were getting earlier.

## Adding Backend Files to Your Existing Repository

Here's how to add the backend files to your existing PropXchain repository:

1. First, press 'q' to exit the current git log view in the terminal.

2. Create a new directory for the backend in your existing repository:
   ```
   mkdir -p backend
   ```

3. Copy the backend files to this directory:
   ```
   copy render-server.js backend\server.js
   copy render-package.json backend\package.json
   copy render-README.md backend\README.md
   copy render-gitignore backend\.gitignore
   copy render-deployment-guide.md backend\deployment-guide.md
   ```

4. Add these files to your Git repository:
   ```
   git add backend/
   ```

5. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add backend server for contact form"
   ```

6. Push to GitHub using the correct branch name (main):
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Create a Separate Repository for the Backend

If you prefer to keep the backend separate from your main repository:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: PropXchain-Backend
   - Description: Backend server for PropXchain contact form
   - Choose Public or Private
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Navigate to the propxchain-backend directory:
   ```
   cd propxchain-backend
   ```

3. Initialize a new Git repository (if not already done):
   ```
   git init
   ```

4. Add all files:
   ```
   git add .
   ```

5. Commit the files:
   ```
   git commit -m "Initial commit for PropXchain backend"
   ```

6. Add your GitHub repository as the remote:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/Madhatt4/PropXchain-Backend.git
   ```

7. Push to GitHub using the main branch:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Deploying to Render

After successfully pushing to GitHub, you can deploy to Render by following the instructions in the render-deployment-guide.md file.

Remember to update the URL in js/contact-form-js.js to match your actual Render service URL after deployment.
