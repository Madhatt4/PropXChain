# PROPCHAIN
## Revolutionizing UK Property Transactions Through Blockchain Technology
### Business Plan 2025-2028

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PropChain is a blockchain-based property transaction system that transforms the UK housing market by reducing transaction times from 12-16 weeks to 3-4 weeks while cutting direct costs by approximately 48%. Starting with new build properties in North Wales, PropChain creates a secure, transparent ecosystem where property information is verified and stored on the blockchain, transaction steps are automated through smart contracts, and all parties gain real-time visibility through an intuitive dashboard.

The system front-loads due diligence through comprehensive seller information packs and leverages artificial intelligence to assist with document analysis. Integration with mortgage technology providers enables verification of financing conditions without directly handling financial applications. This approach addresses key inefficiencies in the traditional property transaction process while working within existing legal frameworks.

With a B2B strategy focused on property developers as initial partners, PropChain will build a scalable SaaS platform that generates revenue through transaction fees, implementation fees, and annual subscriptions. The company seeks initial investment of £500,000 to develop the platform, secure intellectual property protection, and establish the first developer partnerships. With projected revenue of £3.27 million by year three and a clear path to profitability in year two, PropChain represents a transformative opportunity in a traditional market ripe for innovation.

### 2.4 Company History

PropChain was conceptualized in 2024 based on the founder's extensive experience with the inefficiencies of UK property transactions. The founder identified blockchain technology as a potential solution to the sequential, paper-based processes that characterize traditional property sales.

After researching existing solutions and regulatory frameworks, the founder developed the PropChain concept with a focus on practical implementation within existing legal structures. The initial focus on new build properties emerged as a strategic approach to demonstrate value in a controlled environment before tackling the more complex resale market.
