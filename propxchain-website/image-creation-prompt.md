# PropChain Website Image Creation Prompt

## Project Overview

PropChain is a blockchain-based property transaction system that reduces UK property transaction times from 12-16 weeks to 3-4 weeks while cutting costs by approximately 48%. We need a set of professional images for our website that effectively communicate our value proposition to our primary audience (property developers) while also serving secondary audiences (conveyancing solicitors, estate agents, and property buyers).

- **Feel**: Forward-thinking but accessible, balancing technical innovation with practical property industry application
- **Aesthetic**: Clean, modern, with subtle blockchain/technology elements
