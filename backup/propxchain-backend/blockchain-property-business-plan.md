# PropChain: Revolutionizing UK Property Transactions
## Business Plan 2025-2028

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

PropChain is a blockchain-based property transaction system that aims to revolutionize the UK housing market, starting with new build properties in North Wales. By front-loading due diligence through comprehensive seller information packs and leveraging blockchain technology for secure, transparent transactions, PropChain will reduce transaction times from 12-16 weeks to 3-4 weeks while cutting costs by approximately 48%.

The system will initially target property developers through strategic partnerships, creating a B2B service model that avoids the high customer acquisition costs of direct-to-consumer approaches. With a clear implementation strategy focused on new builds as a controlled testing environment, PropChain aims to demonstrate measurable improvements in transaction efficiency before expanding to the broader resale market.

Investment of £350,000 is sought to develop the initial platform, secure intellectual property protection, and establish the first developer partnerships. With projected revenue of £3.2 million by year three and a strong value proposition for all stakeholders in the property transaction process, PropChain represents a transformative opportunity in a traditional market ripe for innovation.
