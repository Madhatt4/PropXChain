# Fixing the Git Push Error

I see you're encountering the error: `error: src refspec main does not match any`. This typically happens for one of these reasons:

## Issue 1: The default branch name might be "master" instead of "main"

Older Git installations use "master" as the default branch name instead of "main". Try:

```
git push -u origin master
```

## Issue 2: You might not have any commits yet

If the repository doesn't have any commits, you can't push. Let's check and fix this:

```
# Check if you have any commits
git log

# If no commits, create one
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for PropXchain backend"

# Then try pushing again
git push -u origin master  # or main
```

## Issue 3: The remote URL might be incorrect

You need to replace "YOUR-USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username:

```
# Check your current remote URL
git remote -v

# If it's incorrect, remove it and add the correct one
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME/propxchain-backend.git

# Then try pushing again
git push -u origin master  # or main
```

## Complete Fix (Step by Step)

Here's a complete set of commands to fix the issue:

```
# 1. Check if you have any commits
git log

# 2. If no commits, add and commit your files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit for PropXchain backend"

# 3. Check your remote URL
git remote -v

# 4. Update the remote URL if needed
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME/propxchain-backend.git

# 5. Try pushing with 'master' instead of 'main'
git push -u origin master

# 6. If that doesn't work, try creating and pushing a branch explicitly
git checkout -b main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace "YOUR-ACTUAL-USERNAME" with your actual GitHub username.
